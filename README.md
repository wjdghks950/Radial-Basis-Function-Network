# Radial Basis Function Networks

Radial Basis Function Networks (RBF Nets) are used for either regression or function approximation.
It uses a simple one-layer hidden layer than consists of "basis functions" (in this case we use Gaussian curves).

In other words, RBF networks can learn to approximate the underlying trend/pattern using k Gaussian curves.


## Run

python rbfn.py
